# limit-fs
FUSE filesystem that removes the oldest files whenever the used space
reaches the set percentage.

You can use it in a no empty directory, anything you write in will be
written in the underlying filesystem. After unmounting it all files
remain in the unmounted directory.

## How to use
Once limit-fs is installed running it is very simple:
```
limit-fs [FUSE options] [mount options] mountPoint
```
It is _strongly recommended_ to run limit-fs as regular user (not as
root). For this to work the mount point must be owned by the user.

To unmount the filesystem use `fusermount -u mountpoint`

## File-system specific options

You can specify the options:

| long option | short option | default | description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| --usage-limit=<d> | -u | *80* | set the usage limit in percentage. |
| --help            | -h |      | print help message |
| --version         | -V |      | print version |

## Runtime mounting
```
limit-fs --usage-limit=90 /mnt/
```

## Mounting automatically at boot time with fstab

Add the FS to the */etc/fstab* file. For example take the line:
```
limit-fs   /mnt/tmpfs/limitfs	limit-fs	usage-limit=95,id=1000,gid=1000,user	0 0
```
Second part is the mount point which the limit-fs is mounted.

Next use limit-fs in the file system type.

Then comes the options **usage-limit=95,uid=1000,gid=1000,user**

## Mounting automatically at boot time with systemd

The name of file for automatic mounting must reflect the mount point,
to doesn't make a mistake use the command to compose the name:
```
$ systemd-escape -p --suffix=mount /path/to/mount/point
path-to-mount-point.mount
```
Substitute */path/to/mount/point* with the correct mount point. If the
mount point does not exist at the time of mounting, it is created.

 1. Create the file to setup the mount itself

 ```
# cat > /etc/systemd/system/path-to-mount-point.mount <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=limit-fs

[Mount]
What=limit-fs
Where=/path/to/mount/point
Options=usage-limit=95,uid=1000,gid=1005,users
Type=limit-fs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
 ```

 2. Create the file to perform automatic mounting

 ```
# cat > /etc/systemd/system/path-to-mount-point.automount <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Automount limit-fs

[Automount]
Where=/path/to/mount/point

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
 ```

 3. Notify systemd there are some new files available

 ```
# systemctl daemon-reload
 ```

 4. Enable the automount

 ```
# systemctl enable path-to-mount-point.automount
 ```
